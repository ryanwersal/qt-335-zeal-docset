# Qt 3.3.5 Docset for Zeal/Dash

Very primitive docset for Qt 3.3.5. It is good enough for use but far from ideal.

### To Build

1. Clone this repo
2. Copy docs/html folder from your Qt 3.3.5 installation
3. Run `./gendocset.py`

### What Works

- Classes
- Methods

### What Doesn't Work

- Most everything else
